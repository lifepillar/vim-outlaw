Section 1: Introducing myself                  *outlaw-introduction*

Hi, I am Outlaw, and I am wanted.

I am wanted because I am an outliner, and although many outliners
are already available for Vim, I am different. Striving for the same
minimalist philosophy followed by plugins like Commentary, Dirvish
or Sneak, I do not try to reinvent the wheel. The price on my head
is about 250 LoC.

Here is a very simple outline which you may start playing with:
>
  vim: set tw=80 sw=4 ts=4 sts=0 et ft=outlaw:
  === My biography
      The secret of a long life is trying not to shorten it.
      === Travel to the East
          === The telegram
              === Meeting with Nobody
              === The bomb
          === Searching for a brother
              === The Wild Bunch

  === Things to do
      [x] Clean boots
      [ ] Brush the horse
          You may lead him to the water if you want, but don't
          expect him to drink.
      [ ] Wear the sheriff's badge
<
(Hint: the modeline will be hidden if you set |'conceallevel'|.)

I interpret lines starting with `===`, `[x]`, `[-]` or `[ ]`,
followed by a space, as topics. Each topic must be on a single line.
The pattern defining a topic may be fully customized by setting
|g:outlaw_topic_mark|, shouldn't you like my admittedly biased
choice.

Topics may be indented to form a hierarchy or outline. I support up
to nineteen levels (ten are highlighted by default, see
|g:outlaw_levels|). I work with most (sensible) combinations of
|'shiftwidth'|, |'tabstop'|, |'softtabstop'| and |'smarttab'| (I'll
tell you if I don't like your settings).

For me, everything that does not look like a topic (including blank
lines) is body text (notes). I couldn't care less about the format
or indentation of your notes (although I can help you aligning them
with |:OutlawAlignNotes|): each block of body text always belongs to
the topic immediately before it. But don't call it a son of a topic:
you'd better think of body text as being at the same level as the
topic it belongs to (it is possible to fold notes independently,
though: see |g:outlaw_note_fold_level|).

The notes are just plain text, but lines starting with `>` are
highlighted using the `OutlawQuote` highlight group. Besides, lines
starting with `|` are assigned the `OutlawCode` highlight group, which
by default links to |hl-CursorLineNr|.

You may also use `~~~` tags to embed any configured filetype (see
|g:outlaw_fenced_filetypes|). If you don't like `~~~`, the tag may be
changed, too (see |g:outlaw_fenced_tag|).

I let you jump through topics quickly: to the previous or next topic
(<up> and <down>), to the previous or next sibling/cousin (<left>
and <right>), to parent or to uncle (- and +). Press <enter> in
Normal mode to quickly add a new sibling below the current topic, or
<c-k> to add a new sibling above the current topic. Use <c-j> to
make a new child.

Besides, I help you move pieces of your outline around using the
arrow keys in Visual mode (they accept a count, of course). Fix the
indentation with the usual mappings (|=|, |==|, …) if necessary
(your notes will be unaffected).

Folding and unfolding are performed using Vim's default mappings and
controlled using Vim's options (see |fold-options|). In addition,
I provide |gl| to set the fold level according to the level of the
current topic (so that all subtopics are closed), and
|g:outlaw_auto_close| as a better suited alternative to setting
|'foldclose'|.

There's not much else you need to know about me. But read on if you
want to ask me questions.

====================================================================
Section 2: How to do X?                              *outlaw-howto*

Ok Outlaw, how much do you need? ~
Just Vim 7.4.984 or later, compiled with |+comments| and |+folding|.

How do I open files as Outlaw buffers? ~
Just set `ft=outlaw` in the document's modeline, or map the suffix
you want yourself. I do not define any filetype mapping, because
there is no conventional suffix or format for text outlines.

How do I copy/move/delete topics? ~
Fold them (|zc| or |za|), then yank/paste/delete as usual.
Or select some text and move it using the arrow keys.

How do I jump to the previous/next topic header? ~
Use <up> and <down> in Normal mode (these and all other mappings may
be customized, of course).

How do I jump to the parent of the current topic? ~
Type - in Normal mode (even when you are inside the body text).
Pressing - when the cursor is in a top-level topic will cause a jump
to the previous top-level topic, so you may keep pressing - till you
reach the beginning of the document.

May I jump to the (next) uncle of the current topic? ~
Sure, type + in Normal mode (even from inside the body text).
Actually, + will jump to the next great-uncle if the current topic
has no next uncle, or to great-great-uncle if it has no great-uncle,
and so on. Pressing + when the cursor is in a top-level topic will
cause a jump to the next top-level topic, so you may continue
pressing + until you reach the last top-level topic of the document.

How about moving to previous/next sibling or cousin (i.e., ~
between topics at the same level)? ~
Use <left> and <right>, respectively, in Normal mode.

Are all those jumps remembered in the jump list? ~
You bet they do.

How do I display my outline in its full glory? ~
Use |zR| or set |'foldlevel'| to 20.

How do I collapse the outline? ~
Use |zM| or set |'foldlevel'| to 0.

How do I fully expand the outline, but with collapsed body text? ~
With |zR||zm| or by setting |'foldlevel'| to 19.

Note: it is not possible to fold notes independently if
|g:outlaw_note_fold_level| is set to `'='`. You may (temporarily)
toggle the value of |g:outlaw_note_fold_level| using |gy|.

How do I zoom to the desired level? ~
Use |gl| to close all folds deeper than the current one. To set an
arbitrary fold level, just set |'foldlevel'|.

How do I collapse a topic or the body text of a topic? ~
I recommend using |zc| (close). Alternatively, use |za|.

How do I expand a topic or the body text of a topic? ~
I recommend using |zv| (view), which works in all cases. All other
Vim's folding commands work as usual, of course. But keep in mind
that, depending on the value of |g:outlaw_note_fold_level|, you may
need to unfold recursively (|zA| or |zv|) for your notes to become
visible.

How do I shift a topic left or right? ~
Fold it, then use << or >>. Or use <left> and <right> in Visual
mode.

But shifting to the left does not do what I want, because some ~
siblings of the topic I am moving may become its children. How do ~
I promote a topic to uncle? ~
Visually select it, then move it wherever you want, or use something
like |dd+P<<|. Say you have this outline:
>
  === H1
    === H1.1
    === H1.2
    === H1.3
  === H2
<
and the cursor is on H1.1. Then |dd| will delete the line (or the
whole fold if the topic is folded), + will jump to H2, |P| will
paste the deleted topic above H2 and << will move the topic
one-level up. So, the topic will be promoted as you desire:
>
  === H1
    === H1.2
    === H1.3
  === H1.1
  === H2
<
How do I quickly create a sibling/child/uncle of the current topic? ~
To quickly add a new child to the current topic, use <c-j>. Press
<enter> or <c-k> in Normal mode to add a sibling of the current
topic, respectively below or above the current line (this works even
if you are inside the body text of the topic). You may then indent
or outdent as you see fit with |i_CTRL-T| and |i_CTRL-D|,
respectively.

All those mappings automatically copy the topic's prefix from the
current topic, so you don't have to type it yourself (type
|i_CTRL-U| if you want to change it).

How do I get an agenda view (e.g., a list of the TODO items in my ~
outline)? ~
A simple way is to use the quickfix list. For instance:
>
 :vimgrep /^\s*<c-r>=b:outlaw_topic_mark<cr>\s*TODO/ % | copen
<
   or even just:
>
 :vimgrep /TODO/ % | copen
<
You may get creative from there, but be aware that an outliner and
a task manager are like Jack Beauregard and The Wild Bunch.

How do I "zoom into a topic" (get a focused view on a topic)? ~
Install the NrrRgn plugin. You may also like Limelight.

How do I sort topics? ~
If |:sort| (possibly combined with |:global)| doesn't cut it, use
a plugin like AdvancedSorters or vissort. That's not the type of job
I get hired for.

How do I create a checkbox? ~
Do I really have to tell you? Type `[x]`, `[-]` or `[ ]` in Insert
mode.

Isn't there a quicker way? ~
Sure, define a mapping.

Ok, how do I toggle a checkbox's status? ~
Position the cursor inside the checkbox, then type |rx|, |r-| or
|r<spc>| as required.

The checkbox is too far! How do I jump there? ~
Pressing <up> from any point in the topic line or its body text
will put you right inside the checkbox of the current topic.

Other outliners have better horses and shine like the door of ~
a whorehouse. ~
I'm not the kind who needs an audience so I can show off. Btw,
that's not a question.

====================================================================
Section 3: Mappings                                *outlaw-mappings*

These are the default mappings I provide:

  nmap <buffer> gA      <plug>OutlawToggleAutoClose
  nmap <buffer> gl      <plug>OutlawThisFoldLevel
  nmap <buffer> gy      <plug>OutlawBodyTextMode
  nmap <buffer> <up>    <plug>OutlawPrevTopic
  nmap <buffer> <down>  <plug>OutlawNextTopic
  nmap <buffer> <left>  <plug>OutlawPrevSibling
  nmap <buffer> <right> <plug>OutlawNextSibling
  vmap <buffer> <up>    <plug>OutlawMoveUp
  vmap <buffer> <down>  <plug>OutlawMoveDown
  vmap <buffer> <left>  <plug>OutlawMoveLeft
  vmap <buffer> <right> <plug>OutlawMoveRight
  nmap <buffer> -       <plug>OutlawParent
  nmap <buffer> +       <plug>OutlawUncle
  nmap <buffer> <cr>    <plug>OutlawAddSiblingBelow
  nmap <buffer> <c-k>   <plug>OutlawAddSiblingAbove
  nmap <buffer> <c-j>   <plug>OutlawAddChild

There's no way these mappings are good for everyone. Feel free to
override them in your |.vimrc|. You may also prevent me from
defining any mapping by setting |g:no_outlaw_maps| or
|g:no_plugin_maps| to 1.

====================================================================
Section 4: Commands                                *outlaw-commands*

                                                 |:OutlawAlignNotes|
Shift all the notes in the outline under their respective headers,
with the exception of flush-left notes, which are left untouched.
Flush-left notes are defined as notes whose first line has
indentation equal to zero.

You may control the relative indentation of the notes with
|g:outlaw_note_indent|.

====================================================================
Section 5: Customization                      *outlaw-customization*

                                               *g:outlaw_auto_close*
                                               *b:outlaw_auto_close*
When set to 1, close the current fold (i.e., the fold at the cursor
line) before using an Outlaw jump command. This is a less aggressive
form of fold closing compared to setting |'foldclose'| to "all",
because it allows you to have more than one open fold at a time.
Set to 0 if you do not want folds to be closed, or if you prefer to
set |'foldclose'|.
>
  let g:outlaw_auto_close = 1
<
Fold auto-closing may also be toggled at any time using |gA|.

                                              *g:outlaw_fold_prefix*
                                              *b:outlaw_fold_prefix*
The symbol used to indicate that a fold is closed.
>
  let g:outlaw_fold_prefix = '(+)\ '
<
Note: spaces must be escaped.

                                              *g:outlaw_folded_text*
                                              *b:outlaw_folded_text*
The text that is displayed for folded body text when
|g:outlaw_note_fold_level| is not set to `'='`.
>
  let g:outlaw_folded_text = '[…]'
<
                                          *g:outlaw_note_fold_level*
                                          *b:outlaw_note_fold_level*
The foldlevel of the body text. The value of this variable should be
either '=' (same foldlevel as the topic header) or 20. If you use
20, you may fully expand the outline while keeping the body text
folded by setting |foldlevel| to 19. The value of this variable may
be quickly toggled using |gy|.
>
  let g:outlaw_note_fold_level = '='
<
                                               *g:outlaw_fenced_tag*
The tag to be used for nested filetypes. This is a regular
expression.
>
  let g:outlaw_fenced_tag = '\~\~\~'
<
                                         *g:outlaw_highlight_groups*
A List of highlight groups for the different indentation levels.
The elements of the list are reused cyclically, so you may define
less elements than the number of levels. If you don't want any
highlighting, set this variable to `['Normal']` (or even better, set
|g:outlaw_levels| to an empty list).
>
  let g:outlaw_highlight_groups =
    \ ['Statement', 'Identifier', 'Constant', 'PreProc']
<
                                                   *g:outlaw_levels*
A List of Strings used to define the highlight groups for the
different indentation levels. By default, ten levels are
highlighted.
>
  let g:outlaw_levels =
    \ ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V', 'VI', 'VII', 'VIII', 'IX', 'X']
<
                                         *g:outlaw_fenced_filetypes*
A List of syntax filetypes that can be nested into an outline.
>
  let g:outlaw_fenced_filetypes = []
<
For example, if you put this in your |.vimrc|:
>
  let g:outlaw_fenced_filetypes = ['sql']
<
then when you write something like:
>
  === My plan
    Here it is:
    ~~~sql
    select money from bank where sheriff is null;
    ~~~
<
the part between `~~~` will be highlighted as SQL. The delimiters
may be hidden by setting |'conceallevel'|.

                                              *g:outlaw_note_indent*
                                              *b:outlaw_note_indent*
An integer specifying the desired indentation of the body text with
respect to its header, in number of |shiftwidth()|s. This value is
used when updating the indentation of the notes, either explicitly
with |:OutlawAlignNotes| or implicitly when moving some text up and
down in Visual mode.
>
  let g:outlaw_note_indent = 1
<
Note: flush-left notes, that is, notes whose first line has zero
indentation, are never realigned. So, this value is ignored for
flush-left notes.

                                               *g:outlaw_topic_mark*
                                               *b:outlaw_topic_mark*
A regular expression that defines a topic's prefix.
>
  let g:outlaw_topic_mark =
    \  '\(=== \|\[x\ze\] \|\[ \ze\] \|\[-\ze\] \)'
<
In this regular expression you may use |\ze| to denote the place
where the cursor should be put when jumping to a topic line. The
cursor is placed at the end of the match by default.

Section 7: Credits                                  *outlaw-credits*

A man who is a man needs something to believe in. My main source of
inspiration has been the epic TimeOut Outliner for AppleWorks (yes,
I am talking Apple II!). Simple, yet so effective. And no, I am not
nearly as good as TimeOut!
